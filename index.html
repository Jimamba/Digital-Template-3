<h2>Betrayal</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A four-player game where one player must trust the others not to squash him, however if
they do betray the player they are at risk when it's their turn to control the victim.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have this sense of negotiation and trust with one another, however the
game's built around grudges forming. So when a player is betrayed, I want them to feel the
need to get payback on the player who betrayed them. So it turns into a who-can-you-trust,
kind of deal.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Party Game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
One player is the victim, in ten seconds they can move using the left and right arrow keys under a suspended block. At the end of
ten seconds they will be unable to move. The three other players control the suspended blocks.Once ten seconds is up, they will be
allowed to make the decision whether or not to squash the player if they are able to. Block one is dropped by the Q button, block two by
the W button, and block 3 by the E button. Once the round has ended with either the player being squished or safe, the players must
rotate their positions clockwise as to freshen up the experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Swapping control of certain sprites, tying in outside game mechanics with the digital game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The act of having to negotiate and trust other players that might not work with you is a
pretty original feature for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game has no setting or premise. It's merely a party game that is meant to facilitate
a sense of "payback". 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game does not have a story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers that enjoy party-style games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
10 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to win over a single person and hide under their block. Trying to win over everyone is
pretty hard.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music -> Living Tombstone (Youtube Music Artist)
Squishing sound effect -> SoundBible.com
Everything else is original.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game builds off of my previous prototypes, while also introducing a basic timer from
the basic timer Phaser example. I also tried to implement a menu/start button, but was 
unable to figure it out in time.
